  description: "This example project works on clustered LXD.
    But as it uses a NAT network interface, all containers must be in the same
    member of the LXD cluster, otherwise Kubernetes will not be able to
    communicate with the nodes. To do this, I use the target option to specify
    the LXD member that I need to create containers to be used by Kubernetes. 
    Also, access to Kubernetes does not work from the local network, it only
    works from the machine on which LXD is installed. Access to Kubernetes must
    be via IP since the domain configured in the project is internal to the
    containers. To use the domain we must create a hosts record on the machine
    where LXD is installed pointing to the master plane IP or add the
    option KubeConfigEndpointUseIP: true, in the project configuration, as the case
    may be. With this option, kube config is configured with the IP and not the 
    domain.
    This example project uses MetalLB to allow the creation of LoadBalancres
    in Kubernetes with an external IP. For this to be possible we must define
    the DHCP range on the project bridge, in order to reserve some IPs for
    MetalLB to use to assign to LoadBalancers. And configure the MetalLB
    IP poll accordingly.
    This project also makes use of secondary storages, where three storages
    are created in lxd and a volume is created in each of these storages.
    These LXD volumes are mounted in containers. This way, it demonstrates
    how to use storage and volumes. We could create volumes on SSD disks for
    the database, for example, another volume for assets, etc.
    This example uses CRI-O to run containers on Kubernetes."
