### Setting up K8s Cluster using LXC/LXD 
> **Note:** For development purpose and not recommended for Production use

#### Installing the LXC on Ubuntu 
```
$ sudo snap install lxd
```

#### Configuring LXD
We must create a bridge in Linux first and specify in LXD the bridge we want LXD to use. To be able to use the examples we created a bridge with the name "lxdbridge".


You can follow this article on how to create a bridge in Linux if you need or any other or several if you prefer.

#### Clone the project
You can clone the repository wherever you want.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jomisica/lxd-projects-provisioning-kubernetes.git
```

#### Enter the project directory
```
$ cd lxd-projects-provisioning-kubernetes
```

#### Run the script
The cluster-config-data.csv file defines how many projects will be created and their properties. In the cluster-config-data.csv file there are three projects for LXD, in each project a master plane and two workers are created.

These settings can and should be changed to suit each personâ€™s needs.

Within the lxd/profiles directory there is a profile for each of the containers that are used for kubernetes, these profiles must be configured accordingly. In this case I use a bridge named lxdbridge.

I will improve and comment on how to configure and use this script, but with time.
```
$ bash lxd-kube provision
```
